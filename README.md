# age_gender_prediction

Age and gender, two of the key facial attributes, play a very foundational role in social interactions, making age and gender estimation from a single face image an important task in intelligent applications, such as access control, human-computer interaction, law enforcement, marketing intelligence and visual surveillance, etc.
Automatic age and gender classification has become relevant to an increasing amount of applications, particularly since the rise of social platforms and social media.
Nevertheless, performance of existing methods on real-world images is still significantly lacking, especially when compared to the tremendous leaps in performance recently reported for the related task of face recognition.
By learning representations through the use of deep-convolutional neural networks (CNN), a significant increase in performance can be obtained on these tasks. 
We evaluate the Age and gender estimation and show it to dramatically outperform current state-of-the-art methods.

You have to download two pre-trained files for age and gender separately. The links are given below:
